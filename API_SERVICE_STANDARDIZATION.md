# API Service Standardization Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the standardization work completed on the Angular services that interact with the backend API. 
The goal was to implement a consistent response format, proper typing, and ensure that all services follow similar patterns.

## Standardized Response Format

All services now use a consistent `ApiResponse<T>` interface:

```typescript
export interface ApiResponse<T> {
  data: T;
  total?: number;
  page?: number;
  limit?: number;
  success?: boolean;
  message?: string;
}
```

This format ensures that components can reliably access:
- `data` - The actual response data
- `total` - Total number of items (for pagination)
- `success` - Whether the request was successful
- `message` - Any status or error message

## Helper Methods

All services now include standardized helper methods:

1. `buildHttpParams` - For converting object parameters to HTTP query parameters
2. `wrapResponse` - For wrapping single object responses in the ApiResponse format
3. `wrapArrayResponse` - For wrapping array responses with proper pagination info

## Typed Interfaces

Each service now has properly defined TypeScript interfaces for:
- Request payloads
- Response objects
- Domain entities

This provides better type safety, IDE auto-completion, and documentation.

## Services Updated

The following services were updated with standardized patterns:

1. **GovernanceServices**
   - User, Account, Asset, Role, Permission, Team, Policy interfaces
   - Comprehensive CRUD operations for all governance entities
   - Proper response wrapping and error handling

2. **DataProductServices**
   - DataProduct, DataProductSubscription, DataProductMetrics interfaces
   - Full product lifecycle management (create, update, publish, archive)
   - Subscription and metrics endpoints

3. **DataMeshServices**
   - DataContract, Domain, LineageGraph, QualityMetric, QualityRule interfaces
   - Domain management, data contracts, lineage tracking
   - Quality metrics and schema registry

4. **DiscoveryServices**
   - CatalogItem, ApiInfo, DataSource, TableSchema interfaces
   - Catalog management, API exploration, data source discovery
   - Schema inspection and data preview capabilities

5. **ObservabilityServices**
   - Metric, Dashboard, HealthStatus, Alert, AuditLog interfaces
   - Monitoring, alerting, and dashboard management
   - Health checks, audit logs, and usage analytics

6. **ProfileServices**
   - UserProfile, UserPreferences interfaces
   - Profile management, password updates, avatar handling
   - Notification settings and session management

7. **AuthServices**
   - LoginRequest, SignUpRequest, AuthResponse interfaces
   - Authentication flows, token management
   - Account verification and password reset
   - Fixed SignUpRequest interface to include `full_name` field required by the signup component

## Benefits

1. **Consistency** - All services now follow the same patterns and response format
2. **Type Safety** - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces prevent runtime errors
3. **Maintainability** - Common patterns make services easier to understand and extend
4. **Error Handling** - Standardized error formatting and handling
5. **Pagination Support** - Consistent handling of paginated responses

## Next Steps

1. Update components to use the new typed service methods
2. Implement proper error handling in components
3. Add unit tests for the services
4. Consider implementing state management for complex data flows
