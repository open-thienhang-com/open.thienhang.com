# RBAC Management Implementation Summary

## Completed Changes

### 1. Sidebar Structure Update
- **Separated Governance from RBAC**: Created a new "RBAC Management" section in the sidebar
- **Governance Section**: Now contains only Policies, Assets, Permissions, and Roles
- **RBAC Management Section**: Contains Accounts, Users, and Teams
- **Benefits**: Better organization and clearer distinction between governance and RBAC functionality

### 2. Account Component Enhancements  
- **Added new imports**: CardModule, SkeletonModule, InputGroupModule, etc.
- **Enhanced Properties**:
  - Added `viewMode` property to toggle between list and card views
  - Added `currentPage` and `pageSize` for better pagination control
  - Added `pageSizeOptions` for configurable page sizes
- **New Methods**:
  - `toggleViewMode()`: Switch between list and card layouts
  - `onPageSizeChange()`: Handle page size selection
  - Enhanced `getAccounts()` method with proper pagination
- **Fixed API Integration**: 
  - Removed `createAccount()` and `deleteAccount()` methods (not supported by API)
  - Updated error handling for unsupported operations
  - Updated pagination to use `pageSize` instead of `tableRowsPerPage`

### 3. Account Template Updates
- **Added View Toggle Button**: Users can switch between list and card views
- **Enhanced Search Controls**: Added search input with icon in dedicated control panel
- **Page Size Selection**: Users can choose how many items per page (10, 25, 50, 100)
- **Disabled Create Account**: Removed "Add Account" button since API doesn't support creation
- **Updated Delete Button**: Disabled delete buttons with clear tooltip explaining limitation

## In Progress

### 4. Account Template Layout (Partial)
- **Search and Controls Panel**: Added new control panel above the table
- **Card View Layout**: Need to add card view implementation
