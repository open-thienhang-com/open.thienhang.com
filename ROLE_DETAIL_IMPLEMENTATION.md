## API Integration

### Role Detail Endpoint
- **URL**: `https://api.thienhang.com/governance/roles/roles/{kid}`

    "contact": [...],
    "type": "governance",
    "permissions": [...]
  }
  ```

### Role Status Update Endpoint

## UI/UX Features

### Role Header

### Tabbed Interface
1. **Overview Tab**
   - Contact information display
   - Quick statistics with icons
   - Role metadata

2. **Permissions Tab**
   - Paginated table of role permissions
   - Permission details including code, action, and assets
   - Asset count badges

3. **Users Tab**
   - Table of users assigned to this role
   - User status and department information
   - Action buttons for user management

4. **Teams Tab**
   - Table of teams assigned to this role
   - Team type and member count
   - Team status indicators

### Interactive Elements
- Copy-to-clipboard for role ID
- Status toggle with confirmation dialogs
- Delete functionality with confirmation
- Navigation breadcrumbs
- Back button to roles list

## Error Handling

### API Error Handling
- Network errors with retry suggestions
- 404 errors with clear "Role Not Found" messages
- Generic error fallbacks with user-friendly messages
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

### UI Error States
- Role not found page with navigation options
- Empty states for each tab when no data available
- Loading indicators during API calls
- Toast notifications for user feedback

## Navigation Flow
1. User clicks "View Details" button on role in roles list
2. Navigation to `/governance/roles/{role.kid}`
3. Route parameter `id` is extracted
4. API call made to fetch role details using the `kid`
5. Role details displayed in tabbed interface
6. User can edit, toggle status, or delete role
7. Back button returns to roles list

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term
- Add role editing modal or dedicated edit page
- Implement role assignment to users/teams
- Add role duplication functionality
- Implement role hierarchy visualization

### Medium-term
- Add role usage analytics
- Implement role permission impact analysis
- Add role history and audit trail
- Implement bulk operations for roles

### Long-term
- Add role-based access control testing
- Implement role recommendation engine
- Add role compliance reporting
- Implement role lifecycle management

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Tests
- Test component lifecycle methods
- Test API service calls and error handling
- Test user interactions and form validations
- Test navigation and routing

### Integration Tests
- Test complete role detail flow
- Test API integration with real endpoints
- Test error scenarios and fallbacks
- Test responsive design across devices

### E2E Tests
- Test role detail navigation from roles list
- Test role status updates
- Test role deletion workflow
- Test accessibility compliance

## Accessibility Features
- ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management
- Alternative text for icons

## Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading for role detail component
- Caching of API responses (5-minute TTL)
- Efficient change detection
- Minimal DOM updates
- Optimized bundle size

## Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization
- CSRF protection for API calls
- Role-based access control
- Secure clipboard operations
- XSS prevention measures

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

This implementation provides a comprehensive role detail page that follows modern web development best practices and integrates seamlessly with the existing governance module architecture.
